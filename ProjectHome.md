UFL-Workflow is a Web application which you can use to track requests through processes that you define.

For example, professors at the [University of Florida](http://www.ufl.edu/) must submit forms to create new undergraduate and graduate courses. These forms were historically sent via snail mail to each office that approved them. UFL-Workflow makes this process electronic, where the documentation is readily available and easily searchable.

The application is maintained by University of Florida [Web Administration](http://www.webadmin.ufl.edu/). Let us know if you find it useful.
