UFL-Workflow is a Web application which you can use to track requests
through processes that you define.

For example, professors at the University of Florida must submit forms
to create new undergraduate and graduate courses. These forms were
historically sent via snail mail to each office that approved
them. UFL-Workflow makes this process electronic, where the
documentation is readily available and easily searchable.

The application is maintained by University of Florida Web
Administration. This repository serves as a mirror of our private
repository. If this application is useful to you, patches are always
welcome.

Run script/ufl_workflow_server.pl to start the application.

Out of the box, the application is not configured with a database. You
will need to add connection information to a configuration file,
e.g. ufl_workflow_local.yml.

The application is configured to use a standard username and password
form for logins. However, for demonstration purposes, the application
does not require a password unless you configure it to. Refer to the
Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication documentation for more information.

Currently the application is known to run on DB2 version 8. Some of
the code may fail on other databases, so if you run into trouble
please notify approval@ufl.edu.
